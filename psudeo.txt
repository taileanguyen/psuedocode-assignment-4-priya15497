First, choose all players- 2 or more
Then start seperating the cards evenly by the number of players 
To play UNO, each player has to match the card in the discard pile by number, color, or word.
If a player places a wild card:
  Then the player can change the color of play. For Example, if the discard pile was red,
  and a player throws down a wild card and says to change the color to blue 7 that means
  now players have to play with the cards which has the new color or number
If a player pulls out a reverse card:
  the order of the play is changed. which means the order goes the other way around
  so if you are playing in counterwise then it would change to counter clockwise
If a player pulls out a Wild Draw 4 card:
  the player gets to change the color like the wild cardbut also player next
  to him has to pick up four cards
If you have one card left:
  you must shout out UNO! and
  If you don't call "Uno" and you get caught by another player:
    you must pick up two cards from the draw pile and once a player has no cards left the game is over
Points are scored and you start over again
If you win the game:
  you give yourself points according to the number and type of cards left in opponents' hands
  Number cards: Face value 
  Non-wild word cards: 20 points 
  Wild cards: 50 points
The first player to reach 500 points wins the game
